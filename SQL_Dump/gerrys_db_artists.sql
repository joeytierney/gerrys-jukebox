INSERT INTO `artists` VALUES (1,'Fozzy','images/artists/fozzyprofile.png','FOZZY has always been about a heavy groove and a good time. And when you have two high-energy performers like Rich Ward and Chris Jericho\r\n(it’s debatable on who jumps higher onstage) in the band, grooves and good times come easy; but these guys aren’t just entertainers. Ward is one of the \r\nmost versatile and underrated riffers in rock and metal today, who has created his own style of heavy riffs, melodic choruses and the Duke groove...oh \r\nthat crushing groove! And Jericho&#39;s singing ability and overall passion for music makes one wonder just how he is able to find the time to excel in pretty \r\nmuch everything he does. It was these qualities that pushed the band to become one of the hottest up and coming rock acts of the past five years.\r\nAfter the release of 4 studio albums, each more successful and critically acclaimed than the last, it wasn’t until 2012’s &#39;Sin & Bones&#39; that the band started \r\nto hit their stride. Jericho was winding down his involvement with the WWE, the band was touring more, with their live show reputation growing stronger than \r\never. The entertainment, the fun factor, the showmanship and most importantly, THE SONGS, were all there in full force. After touring all of 2012-13 with \r\nMetallica, Shinedown, Avenged Sevenfold and Saxon, the band saw their fanbase grow and diversify.\r\nAfter their hugest charting (#54 on the Billboard 200) and most successful record, 2014&#39;s &#39;Do You Wanna Start A War&#39; and subsequent tour finished at the end \r\nof 2015, the band began focusing on taking their future to a new level creatively and enlisted critically acclaimed song writer Johnny Andrews to produce \r\nthe new record. With Andrews, Ward and Jericho (the team who created FOZZY&#39;s highest charting single &#39;Lights Go Out&#39;) at the helm, FOZZY spent 2016 crafting \r\ntheir new masterpiece for a spring 2017 release.\r\n&#39;After the huge success of the Do You Wanna Start A War record and the tour that followed that saw us share the stage w such incredible bands as Kiss, \r\nSlash & Myles Kennedy, BuckCherry and Theory Of A Deadman, we decided to take 2016 off to recharge and write songs. But now WE&#39;RE BACK with our best \r\nalbum EEEVVVEEERRR and are so excited to destroy stages all across the globe again! There is nothing like playing FOZZY rock n roll to our amazing \r\nfriends worldwide and watching you guys smile, laugh and have a blast...after all, isn&#39;t that what rock n roll is all about? We believe that there&#39;s \r\nonly three things you can count on in life: death, taxes and the fact that if you come to a FOZZY show, you are GOING to have a great time!!

Over the course of nearly 40 years they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other, and with the rapturous receipt of their 16th studio album they’re showing no signs of slowing down. Their 16th, and most recent studio album, neatly encapsulates Iron Maiden’s huge creative range, The Book Of Souls is nothing less than a 92-minute masterpiece - a cannon-blast of exuberant, anthemic bravado that serves as cast-iron confirmation of just how much they have left in the tank. From the infectious, stadium-skewering hooks of The Red And The Black to the lofty ambition of the 18-minute Empire Of The Clouds, it’s the artistic summation of everything that’s given Iron Maiden such deep resonance and universal appeal. Like the breathless excitement and scale of their stage shows, their remarkable new double-album is emblematic of a stout-hearted refusal to do anything by half-measures and an irrepressible sense of fun.<br><br>\n\nFounded by bassist Steve Harris in the mid ‘70s, Iron Maiden were already firmly established as heavy metal’s brightest hopes when they stormed the world with their third album (and first with vocalist Bruce Dickinson) The Number Of The Beast in 1982. It would kick off a decade of classic releases and dogged touring that would come to epitomise the unrelenting, uncompromising, unswerving commitment they are now so well known for. That marvellous decade would also yield seven new studio albums, one live album, seven World Tours, as well as the creation of Eddie - one of the most iconic and recognisable figureheads of our age and the calling card of the most impassioned fan-bases anywhere.</p>\n<h3>MEMBERS</h3>\n<p>Bruce Dickinson(<i>Vocals, Piano</i>)<br>\nDave Murray (<i>Guitar</i>)<br>\nJanick Gears (<i>Guitar</i>)<br>\nAdrian Smith (<i>Guitar, Backing Vocals</i>)<br>\nSteve Harris (<i>Bass, Backing Vocals</i>)<br>\nNicko McBrain (<i>Drums</i>)</p>','EMI','Heavy Metal'),(4,'Drake Bell','images/artists/drakebellprofile.png','\n<p>Though he had been acting since he was five, when he was filmed in his first commercial, Drake Bell (born Jared Drake Bell in Orange County, California) \ndidn’t start playing the guitar until he was cast in the 2001 TV movie Chasing Destiny, also starring the Who’s Roger Daltrey, who gave the young performer \nhis initial lessons.
